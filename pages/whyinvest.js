        <h1>Why Invest?</h1>
        <p>
            Since 2000, the US Inflation rate has been an average of 2.165% per year. In layman terms, inflation can be viewed as the rate of decrease in the purchasing power of money.
             So essentially, if you had $100 in your bank account last year, it would have the same value as
             $97.84 this year. But that's no big deal right? Since banks usually offer an annual interest rate? Well...
      </p>
        <p>
            The issue is that a typical bank saving's account interest rate is about
             0.09%. Meaning each year the money sits in your bank account, it gets devalued at 2.075%!
             I'm annoyed that I lose the money I work for, and you should be too.
      </p>
        <p>
            Even if you find a high interest bank account, the interest rate rates are likely below 2%, so at best, you'll be nearly breaking even.
             But that's not the goal. The goal is to make money and gain financial freedom.
      </p>
        <p>
            And if you agree with my goal, you should be investing.
